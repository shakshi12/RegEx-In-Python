            "\"the tricky crux of the matter is that when people say ‘airborne’ what they often mean is ‘you’re at risk from virus particles hanging in the air — or being kicked back up into the air after falling to the ground — long long after an infectious person sneezed them out’ that’s much more of a risk for smaller ‘aerosol’-end-of-the-spectrum secretions and it turns out that it’s more of a risk for some viruses than for others\"\n",

            "\"i say that based on what insurers did before the affordable care act\" halabi said \"what happened pre-aca was that insurers generally just wouldn’t offer individual policies in the state or they would price them out of reach\"\n",
            "if the affordable care act were struck down and the state law were in place he believes this same thing would happen again\n",
            "\"i think the best way to interpret this\" halabi said \"is that by submitting this both on the governor’s point and on caleb rowden’s for them they can plausibly say to voters ‘oh but we’ve offered something to put in place of the federal law’ but what will happen is that if (the affordable care act) gets struck down insurers will no longer offer those policies in this state so it won’t do anybody any good\"\n",

            "at the same time like other republicans he has said he supports the protections for pre-existing condition coverage he backed a state law intended to protect pre-existing conditions if the affordable care act were overturned but that bill never made it out of committee and a legal scholar says the legislation wouldn’t work — insurers would simply stop offering individual policies at affordable prices leaving people without employer-provided insurance no way to get coverage\n",
            "parson may say that he likes the idea of protections for pre-existing conditions but he has done nothing to put in place effective clear legislation that will provide these protections and by supporting a lawsuit to overturn the affordable care act he has taken steps to overturn a federal law that already protects people with pre-existing conditions \n",

            "it should be noted that sanger enlisted two prominent black civil rights leaders to serve on the advisory board of the negro project: web dubois and mary bethune it’s hard to imagine either would have joined an effort to exterminate blacks\n",

            "two years earlier before barack obama became president congress passed the mental health parity and addiction equity act it said that if insurance offered by large employers — an organization employing more than 50 people — included mental health benefits it had to structure those benefits as well as associated copayments or caps on visits equal to — \"at parity\" with —physical health benefits\n",
            "a key thing to note though is that this 2008 law did not specifically mandate coverage of mental health services\n",

            "if true it would be a figure both staggering and significant to the unfolding debate as americans try to understand how warren’s brand of a single-payer health system could affect their pocketbooks so we decided to dig in\n",
            "a reasonable estimate\n",
            "we contacted the warren campaign which redirected us to a report from the urban institute a washington think tank as well as to federal estimates of household out-of-pocket expenses and premium costs over the next decade\n",
            "the urban report doesn’t include the $11 trillion figure but economist linda blumberg who authored the paper told us the statistic is \"perfectly consistent\" with the analysis\n",
            "if anything she said the number is a lowball figure when blumberg and her team crunched the numbers they found that under the existing health care system americans can expect to pay $117 trillion between out-of-pocket costs – the copays deductibles and uncovered medical expenses – and premiums over the next decade that calculation comes from urban’s model for projecting what individual households might expect to spend factoring in inflation on these types of health costs\n",
            "\"talking about the amount of money we expect households to be spending over time is a very important part of trying to educate people on what single-payer would do and what the tradeoffs are for them\" said blumberg who previously advised the clinton white house on health policy on the numbers \"they’re roughly in the right neighborhood\" she added\n",
            "we consulted other analysts too and as far as we can tell no one else has done a similar calculation\n",
            "experts told us that urban’s estimate — and the warren campaign’s use of it — checks out based on what we know about american health care spending\n",
            "cynthia cox a vice president at the kaiser family foundation and expert on the affordable care act pointed to what a typical american family currently spends on health care: about $5000 per year when you look at out-of-pocket costs and premiums combined extrapolating from there she said warren’s claim seems reasonable (kaiser health news is an editorially independent program of the foundation)\n",
            "\"over the course of 10 years when you add it up — that sounds about right\" cox said \"the reality is people do spend a lot on health care out of their pockets and there’s a lot spent on their behalf by employers or taxpayer-funded programs that they never see\"\n",
            "under warren’s health care plan americans would pay nothing directly out-of-pocket — no premiums copays or deductibles — for health care so that $11 trillion would disappear from the cost side of the ledger\n",

            "analysts also said the $11 trillion number gets at a larger point americans currently pay a lot out-of-pocket on health care certainly some might see a tax hike under warren’s proposed reform or see downward pressure on their salaries\n",

            "since the law went into effect in 2014 it has faced many efforts by republicans in congress including gardner to repeal it\n",
            "it has also faced three supreme court challenges it survived the first two although one ruling allowed states to opt out of its expansion of medicaid programs for the poor the still-pending case was first brought in 2018 by 20 states and is supported by the trump administration that case could overturn the entire law although the court won’t hear arguments on the issue before the election and that brings us back to gardner’s bill an obvious difference between that proposal and the aca is length gardner’s bill is one page while the aca runs to several hundred\n",

            "\"‘guaranteed issue’ is not in the language of the bill\" said miller at aei\n",
            "instead the language may simply prohibit insurers from restricting services related to a medical condition only if they choose to sell an individual insurance in the first place he said\n",
            "compare that with the aca which says every insurer selling individual or group coverage \"must accept every employer and individual in the state that applies\"\n",
            "also needed in legislation aiming to protect people with medical problems said blumberg are provisions for subsidies to help people of low and moderate income afford their premiums the aca has those along with specific enrollment periods so that people don’t wait until they are sick to sign up without them mainly those with medical conditions might sign up driving up costs and premiums that in turn can price people especially the sick out of future coverage\n",
            "another way gardner’s bill differs from the aca is that it does not list benefits that must be included in a health insurance policy the aca requires insurers to cover 10 broad categories of care including hospitalization prescription drugs childbirth substance abuse treatment and mental health care\n",
            "\"without that insurers could sell products that don’t cover very much which is what we had prior to 2014\" blumberg added which is one way to discourage those who are sick from even applying \"it was difficult to find a product that covered prescription drugs and we even saw policies that didn’t cover chemotherapy\"\n",
            "so what about costs\n",
            "gardner’s legislation says insurers can’t \"factor health status into premiums or charges\"\n",
            "so insurers could not charge people more simply because they have diabetes say or cancer still that leaves open a whole lot of other things that insurers could consider when setting premiums for individuals such as such as gender or occupation which could stand in as a proxy for health unlike the aca it does not bar insurers from setting annual or lifetime dollar limits on coverage which could disproportionately affect people with costly medical conditions\n",
            "the aca allows insurers to vary premiums for only three reasons: where people live their age and whether they use tobacco it sets upper limits such as charging older folks no more than three times what younger enrollees pay\n",
            "douglas holtz-eakin president of the american action forum who wrote a blog post cited by the gardner campaign said the proposed legislation is a starting point — a place holder if you will his piece mentioned it near the end of a broader look at the trump administration’s health platform going into the election\n",
            "responding to questions about gardner’s legislation holtz-eakin said that if the aca were to be struck down gardner would likely add provisions to it\n",
            "\"i don’t think it’s intended to be a replacement bill but a provision to make sure people can get coverage\" said holtz-eakin \"it’s quite clear on the aim to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can get insurance but it doesn’t address every single policy issue that’s out there\"\n",
            "health law professor mark hall at wake forest university said gardner’s legislation could survive if the aca were struck down by the supreme court but he noted that congress would be unlikely to adopt the gardner bill as written\n",
            "\"a freestanding protection of pre-existing conditions without any supporting provisions to keep insurance affordable or encourage people to purchase it before they become sick is almost certain to cause serious harms to the market\" hall wrote in an email \"therefore a lot more is needed to overcome legitimate objections that almost certainly will be made from both sides of the political aisle\"\n",
            "our ruling\n",
            "because protecting people with medical conditions requires many moving parts the brevity of gardner’s proposal makes it appear to be a fig leaf for a political problem rather than a means to guarantee protections for people with preexisting conditions\n",
            "the legislation is unclear on whether it guarantees that people with health problems will be able to buy insurance in the first place and even if they can they may well find it priced out of reach because the legislation does not bar insurers from varying premiums widely on the basis of age gender or occupation\n",
            "viewed in its most favorable light gardner’s 117-word proposal would only serve as a place holder for larger legislation upon which more protections would have to be layered to bolster the effectiveness of its guarantee\n",

            "ten billion dollars is a massive amount of money and the figure piqued our interest we wanted to know if this level of medicaid spending could be correct\n",
            "where does the state gets its money for medicaid\n",
            "before diving deeper into rowden’s claim it’s important to get some background on the medicaid program medicaid is designed to provide health coverage for lower-income families people with disabilities senior citizens pregnant women and newborns blind and visually impaired uninsured women families kids and women with breast or cervical cancer as of november 2016 69 million people nationwide were covered through medicaid\n",
            "missouri disperses medicaid to participating residents through its mo healthnet program under the department of social services\n",
            "a document by the missouri budget project explains how missouri funds medicaid\n",
            "the majority of funding for medicaid — 83 percent — comes from the federal government through two programs one program called the federal medical assistance percentage or fmap matches federal government dollars to state dollars spent on health care services based on a percentage rate\n",
            "missouri's fmap rate for fiscal year 2018 is 6321 percent according to the henry j kaiser family foundation this means that for every dollar missouri spends on health care — not just medicaid — the federal government gives $172 \n",
            "of the total money missouri receives from the fmap program only a certain amount goes to medicaid the rest goes toward other health care services the state provides fifty-one percent of missouri's medicaid spending is funded through fmap \n",
            "the other program — federal reimbursement allowance — along with other capital reserves covers another 32 percent of missouri’s spending on medicaid missouri has been participating in this program for 25 years\n",
            "so this leaves missouri picking up only 17 percent of its own medicaid bill this money comes from collected state revenue \n",
            "dan haug acting budget director for the state told us in a phone call that he expects medicaid to cost the state $1021 billion in the coming fiscal year this would make rowden’s statement true but we wanted to check the budget to see where all the medicaid money went\n",

            "finding medicaid spending in the state budget is complicated the bulk of medicaid spending falls under the department of social services in the last fiscal year the state approved $92 billion for the dss $77 billion of which went toward medicaid\n",
            "at first glance this seems like this is the total budget for medicaid in the state there are really no other places in the budget where medicaid is clearly defined as an expense so rowden’s claim about the medicaid budget is false right\n",
            "not so fast\n",
            "in fact medicaid money is spent by more agencies than just the dss it is used for other services spread throughout the state budget most notably in the department of mental health traci gleason the director of communications and public engagement at the missouri budget project confirmed that nearly 20 percent or $2 billion of the medicaid budget goes toward mental health services driving the total budget of medicaid closer to that $10 billion figure\n",
            "where does the rest of medicaid spending go even an expert such as gleason said that’s very tricky to determine part of the reason for this is because portions of the medicaid budget are listed as mo healthnet which is the health care system missouri switched to in 2007\n",
            "through the mo healthnet name a series of supplemental appropriations sections are added at the bottom of the state budget document some of the services funded through supplemental appropriations such as pharmacies physicians and premium services fall under the medicaid budget when you add all the supplemental appropriations together for services that fall under medicaid it comes out to $10023904918 while this falls short of haug’s estimate it does make rowden’s statement about the medicaid budget correct \n",
            "\"it’s really hard to drill down (the medicaid spending) because it’s spread over all sorts of different departments and programs\" gleason said \"overall though sen rowden is correct with his totals\"\n",
            "nevertheless because the state is responsible for funding only 17 percent of the total on medicaid the total amount missouri will spend is $17 billion from state revenue \n",
            "our ruling\n",
            "rowden was trying to illustrate that medicaid spending has reached out-of-control levels according to greitens' budget recommendations for fiscal year 2018 the budget for medicaid has gone up over $1 billion in the last three years and now takes up approximately 37 percent of the state budget despite the growing concern from republicans on the cost of medicaid spending greitens has recommended $107 billion for the service for fiscal year 2018 an increase of over $500 million from fiscal year 2017\n",
            "however it’s important to note that \"we\" — as in the state of missouri — don’t directly fund the entire $10 billion because of the federal medical assistance percentage and the federal reimbursement allowance programs the state only has to spend approximately $17 billion of state revenue on medicaid\n",
            "so while medicaid spending will exceed $10 billion of the nearly $28 billion budget not all of the money is coming directly from the state rowden’s statement is accurate but needs clarification we rate it mostly true\n",

            "subsequent news accounts indicated the idea worked in-state insurers credited the program with lowering premiums by 8% to 14% for 2020 as montana health co-op ceo richard miltenberger told mtn news shortly after the 2019 legislative session \"it allows the insurance companies to have rate stabilization for those really big claims the ones that are the earthquakes in health insurance\" he went on to say that this stability \"brings the cost down for the consumer\" more to the point the american medical association has also stated that reinsurance not only serves to subsidize high-cost patients but \"protects patients with pre-existing conditions\"\n",
            "but there’s a rub\n",
            "the reinsurance program that rosendale touts wouldn’t exist without a state innovation waiver created by the aca which rosendale says he’ll work to repeal that effort will doubtless continue to fuel pitched battles in congress and how the us supreme court may rule on a pending aca challenge remains a point of speculation one thing is clear though: if the entire aca is thrown out the reinsurance program goes with it along with montana’s medicaid expansion and the ban on insurers from excluding people with health problems from affordable coverage\n",
            "when asked about the resulting elimination of the reinsurance program demars reiterated that rosendale’s work as auditor has created a system that will ensure protections for preexisting conditions \"regardless of what happens to the aca\" she did not elaborate or explain what protections would remain if the aca were repealed\n",
            "the short-term plan component\n",
            "in defending his stance on preexisting conditions rosendale continues to be haunted by another health care policy specter from his political past during his unsuccessful challenge against democratic us sen jon tester in 2018 rosendale faced criticism for promoting short-term limited-duration health insurance plans unlike plans offered on the individual marketplace these short-term plans are exempt from the aca’s ban on excluding people with preexisting conditions and under a 2018 regulatory change pushed by the trump administration the length of these short-term plans has been extended from three months to 12 with the potential to renew for up to three years\n",
            "as state auditor rosendale included those plans in his march 2020 roundup of year-round options for immediate coverage they often exclude coverage for a variety of higher-cost benefits in montana for example a review by kff found that of four short-term plans available in billings in 2018 none offered coverage for maternity care mental health substance abuse or prescription drug services (khn is an editorially independent program of kff)\n",
            "historically short-term plans were designed to help individuals fill gaps in health coverage according to dania palanker an assistant research professor at georgetown university’s center on health insurance reforms the role short-term plans play on today’s health insurance landscape is to attract younger healthier individuals seeking low-cost options to cover catastrophic events that splits insurers into two pools — those who are less likely to incur medical expenses and those who are more likely to incur them costs on the individual market go up as a result leaving people with preexisting conditions no other option than to pay higher premiums short-term plans are palanker said \"actively hurting people with preexisting conditions\"\n",
            "\"promoting short-term plans and stumping on supporting protections for preexisting conditions are mutually exclusive\" she continued\n",
            "asked whether the cost-lowering effect of a reinsurance program would be enough to offset the effects of short-term plans palanker said the only way such an offset would be enough is if the program encompassed short-term plans she hasn’t seen that happen anywhere\n",
            "our ruling\n",
            "a campaign ad says that rosendale \"fights for everyone with a preexisting condition\" while it is true that health insurance premiums have dropped during rosendale’s tenure as state auditor the choice to establish montana’s reinsurance program ultimately fell to decision-makers in the state’s legislature and the governor’s office since his ad’s claim simply states that he \"fights\" for people with preexisting conditions his testimony in support of that program and role in securing the state waiver do seem to fit the bill\n",
            "in the long-term however rosendale’s positions begin to run counter to the claim his support for short-term limited-duration plans poses a considerable threat to keeping health insurance affordable for all and absent a solid plan from congress to ensure that state reinsurance programs survive his stated goal of repealing the aca would actually serve to unravel the very protection he’s built his case on\n",

            "we spoke to environmental health researchers unaffiliated with the studies they said it would be very difficult to prove that being born near a superfund site causes kids to be born with birth defects or causes autism it helps that in his statements booker doesn’t try to make that case one caveat though is that a casual listener could draw that conclusion\n",
            "the studies he’s working with are \"fairly exploratory\" said david savitz a professor of epidemiology at brown university’s school of public health while they support the idea of a link between autism and superfund sites or birth defects and such sites they don’t go so far as to support a case for causality other factors could contribute too\n",
            "\"it’s not hard to imagine all the ways the communities proximal to waste sites may be different — a lot of ways other than just having the waste site\" savitz said\n",

            "even so environmental health experts said much more work is needed to understand the nature of that claim risk factors for autism are still not well-identified and congenital abnormalities can refer to a range of different problems — so research that lumps them together may gloss over important distinctions especially when it comes to what might cause a specific birth defect\n",

            "booker is getting at a larger truth: many chemicals found at superfund sites are related to health problems the experts said and those same experts added his environmental justice framing is one that makes sense too given the demographics of those most often affected\n",
            "from a policy standpoint savitz argued booker’s bigger point — that cleaning up superfunds would improve health outcomes in particular for marginalized people — is clearly true\n",
            "the only real issue some suggested is his use of the word \"dramatically\" the data suggests potential correlation but whether it’s \"dramatic\" is far from clear\n",
            "\"certainly there is evidence to back up his claim\" said amanda bakian an assistant professor of psychiatry at the university of utah who studies environmental contributors to autism risk \"there’s been work finding an association but the relationship is modest … we do need more research in this area\"\n",

            "the use of the word \"dramatically\" causes a bit of trouble however the datasets show statistically significant correlations but that isn’t the same thing as a \"dramatically higher rate\"\n",

            "we contacted biden’s campaign to find out the basis for his response staffers sent us an april 9 blog post from the national employment law project an advocacy group for workers that outlines how the trump administration’s osha has failed to stipulate and enforce adequate employee protections during the pandemic they also sent us osha’s april 13 enforcement directive\n",
            "what could osha do\n",
            "osha is tasked with ensuring that workplaces are safe and healthy the agency sets standards and has inspectors determine if workplaces are compliant if they are not osha issues citations and requires employers to address the problem within a certain timeframe failure to do so results in fines or other sanctions\n",
            "these standards tend to be broad statements that can take a decade to develop and implement for instance two obama-era osha officials — david michaels the labor department’s assistant secretary for osha from 2009 to 2017 and debbie berkowitz a senior osha official from 2009 to 2015 — told us they had worked on developing an infectious disease standard for years but that effort was halted in 2017 by the trump administration \n",
            "however osha also can issue an \"emergency temporary standard\" during a public health emergency such as the current coronavirus pandemic\n",
            "major unions including the afl-cio and national nurses united have petitioned osha for an emergency temporary standard that would codify that a variety of types of workers are at risk of exposure to covid-19 and issue detailed safety requirements for specific industries so far though osha has not taken this emergency action\n",
            "also the march advisory guidance is not enforceable said michaels and berkowitz the guideline includes language stating that it is \"not a standard or regulation and creates no new legal obligations\" and though this document sketched out certain recommendations that would reduce workers’ risk of exposure to covid-19 when osha put out its april 13 enforcement directive it didn’t mandate that any of those recommendations be followed by workplaces or enforced by osha inspectors\n",

            "a wrinkle: cheerleading was the only sport in the study with a higher risk of concussion in practice (14 per 10000 aes) than in competition (12 per 10000)--a result comstock attributed to cheerleading not widely being recognized as a sport hence subject to practices in parking lots and on other sketchy surfaces\n",

            "\"for too many americans medicaid is an empty promise finding a physician who will see medicaid beneficiaries can be incredibly challenging because providers are under-reimbursed and cannot afford to provide care at the rates the program pays in fact a study conducted by a team of renowned economists from the massachusetts institute of technology harvard and dartmouth concluded that medicaid’s value to its beneficiaries is significantly lower than the actual cost of the program\"\n",
            "we wondered whether price and his committee were correct to cite the work of three health care academics to support the argument that medicaid is \"an empty promise\" that provides \"significantly lower\" value to its beneficiaries than its actual cost\n",
            "as it turns out it’s more complicated than that in fact one of the paper’s co-authors told politifact that he disputed the connection the committee was seeking to draw\n",
            "about the paper\n",
            "we started our research by locating the paper written by amy finkelstein of mit nathaniel hendren of harvard and erzo fp luttmer of dartmouth and published in june 2015 titled \"the value of medicaid: interpreting results from the oregon health insurance experiment\" it looked at data from oregon’s 2008 expansion of its medicaid rolls\n",
            "oregon’s medicaid program provided a unique opportunity for researchers because the state had only enough funding to cover a portion of residents who wanted to sign up so to distribute spots in the program they set up a lottery this allowed health care economists a rare opportunity to compare health-related outcomes for those with medicaid as well as an uninsured control group (we have previously written about a different study that uses the oregon data)\n",
            "the paper is aimed at hard-core health care wonks but the gist of the authors’ mission was to determine how much of every medicaid dollar benefited recipients directly as opposed to how much benefited the wallets of whoever else would have been paying the health care bills if the person was not covered by medicaid\n",
            "ultimately the authors estimated that between 40 and 80 cents of every dollar benefitted whoever would have been paying those health care costs if medicaid hadn’t been these could be state or local governments the patient’s relatives or friends or health care providers who would otherwise have to eat the unreimbursed costs of care (between 20 and 40 cents of every dollar replaced money that medicaid recipients would have spent on their own)\n",
            "when the study came out some supporters of a more free-market approach to health care touted it as evidence that medicaid wasn’t doing a good job of targeting its dollars and if true this would be an argument for cutting the program or making significant changes to it\n",

            "overall chen said he thought it could be reasonably safe as long as every passenger and crew member wore a mask he also suggested that passengers wipe down the surfaces around them and wash their hands but said there would still be a risk \n",

            "but this beefed up testing is still likely undercounting the problem is that the us outbreak is worse than that of many other countries – so we need to be testing a higher percentage of our population than do others\n",

            "\"we were slow with the testing but very quick with the travel ban and that's been much more critical in saving lives\" watters said in a march 31 episode of \"the five\" on the fox news channel\n",

            "but the experts we spoke to made clear that these restrictions can work only as one (smaller) part of a comprehensive strategy without other aggressive public health measures they would have little value the timing of american restrictions – and how they interacted with other domestic efforts – rendered them ineffective\n",

            "for context the incidence of a severe respiratory illness began to emerge in china late last year these cases were confirmed to be a novel coronavirus by jan 7 and the first american case was reported jan 20 – almost two weeks before any travel restrictions were in effect\n",

            "other research backs that up a paper published in science last month found that when china imposed its own travel restrictions it made only a modest difference in curbing the spread of the coronavirus both domestically and to other countries -- at most buying a few days’ time and this paper also notes travel restrictions were effective only when coupled with other efforts to halt transmission\n",
            "by contrast researchers were unanimous in noting the effectiveness of  robust testing of people who may have been exposed -- and then isolating those who test positive for the virus this test-and-quarantine approach has been proven effective in south korea which experienced its first case on the same day as in the us but where the number of new covid-19 cases is now on a dramatic decline\n",

            "the world health organization makes a similar point: it says temporary restrictions are justified only in narrow circumstances and as a way to buy time but that time the organization says must be used to \"rapidly implement effective preparedness measures\" – like testing\n",

            "another benefit of this attack method which could be used frequently in the run-up to november according to blendon is that it doesn’t require the gop to offer a policy alternative and instead focuses on how medicare for all would eliminate private insurance \n",

            "a public option is generally defined as a health plan administered by the federal government that exists alongside and competes with private health insurance plans on the affordable care act exchanges public option proposals differ by political candidate and can take various forms including medicare or medicaid buy-ins as well as a new government-run entity  \n",
            "opponents of such plans say that a public option which would have the scale and regulatory power of the federal government to set lower reimbursement rates to providers would have a competitive advantage and could put private insurance companies out of business this would leave americans with only one choice ― government-backed insurance but that conclusion is debatable some health care scholars argue a public option would increase competition leading to expanded access to health coverage lower health care costs and lower premiums for consumers \n",
            "in the end the outcomes from implementing this approach are difficult to predict unless a specific plan is released said benedic ippolito a health care research scholar at the american enterprise institute\n",

            "when we asked the nrsc for the evidence to support this position a spokesperson provided an august 2019 study conducted by navigant a consulting firm the study was commissioned by the partnership for america’s healthcare future a health industry coalition including  drugmakers insurance companies and private hospitals the organization opposes medicare for all and a public option\n",
            "the study modeled what would happen to rural hospitals if three separate public option approaches were implemented \n",
            "while it found that a public option could depending on the scenario cause a revenue reduction for rural hospitals of between 23% and 14% the study reached these findings by assuming that the hospitals would be paid at medicare rates \n",

            "\"if the public option is a reasonably generous payer that won’t be the end of rural health care\" said ippolito \"but you can easily imagine due to budgetary concerns a public payer could have a lower reimbursement which would have consequences\" \n",
            "some health policy experts argue that a public option would help rural hospitals by increasing the number of people in rural areas who have health insurance \n",
            "this would \"benefit rural hospitals since getting virtually nothing from uninsured patients is worse than getting a reasonably good rate from the public option\" said gerard anderson a professor of health policy and management at johns hopkins university in baltimore \n",

            "as several experts pointed out this sentence doesn’t make a lot of sense medicare is already a government-run program \n",
            "also the design of most public option proposals thus far keeps medicare and the public option as two separate government programs said linda blumberg a health policy analyst at the urban institute a think tank \n",
            "the nrsc clarified its position and told us it was referring to the idea that a public option would stifle competition in the insurance market eventually leading to only government-run insurance or medicare for all the evidence the nrsc provided to support this claim were quotes from a selection of republicans democrats professors and experts from conservative think tanks saying that the public option is a stepping stone to this single-payer approach \n",
            "but others suggest that’s a big leap in logic \n",
            "\"i think that analysis is almost surely wrong\" said matthew fiedler a fellow with the brookings institution \"in a world where there is a public option the negotiating dynamics between insurers and providers would change substantially\" \n",
            "this would likely create an environment in which private insurers could negotiate lower rates and providers would have to respond to that change in revenue with more efficiencies he added however depending on how a public option plan is structured -- specifically if providers can opt out of participating -- some in-demand providers may choose to stay in private-plan networks where they could negotiate higher payments this would keep private plans competitive  \n",
            "\"i don’t think it’s reasonable to argue that a public option would drive all other plans out of the market\" fiedler said\n",
            "again ippolito said it all depends on how the public option program is designed and he allowed that if providers and hospitals were paid at medicare rates the public option would have a huge competitive advantage over commercial insurers because it would be paying out less for services and then could charge lower premiums and \"there’s no question in the short run that it would be disruptive\"  \n",
            "as we noted earlier the prediction of any outcome is difficult without specifics without details of bullock’s public option plan it’s misleading to characterize the outcome of the public option as surely leading to medicare for all \n",
            "why it matters \n",
            "the race between bullock and daines is indicative of a trend occurring in campaigns across the country republicans often paint democrats as left of the general public and health care has often been one of the issues the gop highlights in that effort \n",
            "in this case the nrsc ad links  bullock to medicare for all despite his expressed support for a public option sean manning bullock’s campaign spokesperson said the governor does not support medicare for all\n",
            "jeremy johnson an associate professor of political science at carroll college in helena montana said that even before covid-19 became a major campaign issue daines echoing a trump theme had pushed the idea that he stood for freedom versus socialism \n",
            "\"one of the things [daines] gives as a symbol of socialism is medicare for all\" said johnson \"because bullock says he favors a public option there is a conflation of that on the republican side to mean medicare for all\" \n",

            "oregon’s medicaid program provided a unique opportunity for researchers because the state had only enough funding to cover a portion of residents who wanted to sign up so to distribute spots in the program they set up a lottery this allowed health care economists a rare opportunity to compare health-related outcomes for those with medicaid as well as an uninsured control group (we have previously written about a different study that uses the oregon data)\n",
            "the paper is aimed at hard-core health care wonks but the gist of the authors’ mission was to determine how much of every medicaid dollar benefited recipients directly as opposed to how much benefited the wallets of whoever else would have been paying the health care bills if the person was not covered by medicaid\n",
            "ultimately the authors estimated that between 40 and 80 cents of every dollar benefitted whoever would have been paying those health care costs if medicaid hadn’t been these could be state or local governments the patient’s relatives or friends or health care providers who would otherwise have to eat the unreimbursed costs of care (between 20 and 40 cents of every dollar replaced money that medicaid recipients would have spent on their own)\n",
            "when the study came out some supporters of a more free-market approach to health care touted it as evidence that medicaid wasn’t doing a good job of targeting its dollars and if true this would be an argument for cutting the program or making significant changes to it\n",

            "at yale-new haven kenney said the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear battelle’s 20-time reusability metric he added was calculated without factoring in the impact of regular hospital use\n",

            "that analysts said is in fact a good proxy for whether people can’t afford insulin and it may understate the problem said dr kasia lipska the endocrinologist who led the yale study since it doesn’t account for people who keep buying medication but skimp on groceries or other necessities as a result\n",

            "but experts broadly suggested that the findings in the three reports referenced — one peer-reviewed academic paper and two surveys — amply support her claim and the broad meaning of the phrase \"cannot afford\" means the problem could be more significant than these datasets suggest since they measure only people going without medication not those for whom insulin prices maybe create other financial issues\n",

            "but analyzing the impact is tricky on one hand morgan said rural hospitals often operate on tighter budgets — and lower government payments without private cash could exacerbate the challenge but on the other rising bad debt among rural hospitals which often treat high levels of uninsured patients means coverage expansions could be welcome especially if congress paid rural hospitals at a separate enhanced rate\n",

            "the current medicare for all bill in congress delegates to the federal government the task of setting up a payment schedule for hospitals and doctors\n",
            "politically anderson argued the odds are \"quite low\" that the government would decide to pay all hospitals the current medicare rates for all services though it would set a lower price than what many private plans now pay\n",
            "how does this work in practice there’s one example in delaney’s own backyard: maryland has what’s called \"all-payer rate setting\" in which the state sets what hospitals can charge for certain services maryland’s approach which was first implemented in 1977 and continues to be modified has ultimately helped limit spending growth for individual hospital admissions\n",

            "\"it is not easy — it’s not a wave of the hand to fix this\" blumberg said\n",
            "after all any government single-payer plan would likely pay less than private plans do and economists argue it should if policymakers are serious about bringing down health care costs but that means switching over would require a \"long transition period\" to prevent major disruption to how hospitals function and how people get care berenson said\n",

            "that matters because children’s mental health care issues are often detected in school settings the school psychologists provide the first line of treatment and often set in motion any necessary referrals to specialists their role is complicated by the fact that beyond school walls there is a serious shortage of adolescent and child psychiatrists\n",

            "both the 1115 and 1400 ratios mask wide national disparities doe’s data suggests that more than 13 million students go to school without any psychologist on staff more than 1 million students go to schools that not only do not have a psychologist on staff but also no guidance counselor or social worker\n",

            "preventive mental health care could help address this trend most students who receive this care get at least their first assessment in schools and if there isn’t someone on hand to provide it they probably go without\n",

            "the reasons are multiple for one thing research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is also masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure\n",
            "and it’s not as simple as doing a load of laundry \"decontamination is a complicated process\" said hana el-samad a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the university of california-san francisco who researches n95 sanitization \"assessing how well it works and which n95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research\" she said \n",

            "at yale-new haven kenney said the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear battelle’s 20-time reusability metric he added was calculated without factoring in the impact of regular hospital use\n",
            "in addition decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator’s fit \n",
            "\"if [an n95] doesn’t fit well then air will leak around the sides and it doesn’t matter how good a filter it is\" kenney said\n",
            "plus using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place used masks must be safely collected ― since they could be covid-contaminated and pose a biohazard — and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility \n",
            "\"these are all complicated processes that need to be done right\" el-samad said\n",
            "she offered a key takeaway: technology like battelle’s can help but nothing substitutes for new n95s\n",
            "our ruling\n",
            "in describing ongoing efforts to reuse protective respirators trump said the united states is using \"some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask\" that he argued \"is like ordering 20 times more masks\"\n",
            "it is true that technology exists to sterilize n95s up to 20 times but there are knowledge gaps and other shortcomings that limit how effective this process is government authorities and health care researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and it is in no way as effective as \"ordering 20 times more masks\"\n",

            "however two giant problems arose first cobra which allows individuals to continue their employer-provided coverage for up to 18 months if they pay the entire premium themselves (plus a small administrative fee) is prohibitively expensive for most people in 2019 the average premium for a single worker was $599 per month\n",
            "the other problem was that even if a former worker did manage to pay for cobra coverage until that 18-month period ended there was no limit on how much insurers could charge for the conversion policies so even if they were technically available they were frequently unaffordable\n",

            "later in his answer to the question posed at the hill’s summit azar pointed out that there are significant affordability problems with coverage under the aca as well \"so we will work with congress if the time ever comes to get real affordable solutions\" he said that’s true… aca plans even with subsidies can be too expensive for some people and prohibitive for those who earn just slightly too much to qualify for government help earlier this month democrats in the house passed a bill to make aca plans more affordable \n",

            "sanders’ figures come from a study published feb 15 in the lancet a british medical journal\n",

            "the price tag of medicare for all has been fiercely debated and some previous analyses have suggested that the proposal would increase health spending not decrease it but sanders is relying on the lancet paper — which has a cost estimate that is the lowest in the neighborhood of $17 trillion over 10 years — to argue that the suite of financing mechanisms he has proposed would more than cover the cost of his health bill (funding would include taxes on high earners a new payroll tax and 4% income premiums for the majority of families) most other estimates place the cost between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over a decade which would make paying for it far more difficult  so we decided to take a closer look\n",
            "we reached out to one of the study’s authors but never heard back \n",
            "a spokesperson for the sanders campaign said the paper is \"similar to 22 other recent studies that have also shown that moving to a single-payer healthcare system will cost less than our current dysfunctional healthcare system\" (we asked for those 22 other studies but as of publication hadn’t received them from the campaign however an independent researcher provided us with this related analysis)\n",

            "for instance the researchers calculate $782 billion in savings from providing primary care to uninsured people — $704 billion from avoided hospitalizations and $78 from avoided emergency room visits but previous evidence suggests that logic is suspect at best \n",
            "when states expanded medicaid under the affordable care act providing new insurance to people who had previously lacked coverage avoidable hospitalizations and emergency room visits didn’t disappear because people could suddenly use preventive care noted ellen meara a professor at the harvard th chan school of public health that evidence doesn’t appear anywhere in the lancet paper\n",
            "\"the notion that we’re going to get rid of all these avoidable visits — that’s not been borne out\" she said \n",
            "the researchers also assume that a medicare for all system would pay hospitals at a maximum of medicare rates\n",
            "that’s tricky in 2017 the nonpartisan medicare payment advisory commission estimated that on average a hospital has a -99% margin on a patient who is insured through medicare (private pay helps make up that difference) some hospitals certainly would be able to swallow this cost but others would struggle to stay afloat said adrianna mcintyre a health policy researcher at harvard university \n",

            "missouri's fmap rate for fiscal year 2018 is 6321 percent according to the henry j kaiser family foundation this means that for every dollar missouri spends on health care — not just medicaid — the federal government gives $172 \n",
            "of the total money missouri receives from the fmap program only a certain amount goes to medicaid the rest goes toward other health care services the state provides fifty-one percent of missouri's medicaid spending is funded through fmap \n",

            "finding medicaid spending in the state budget is complicated the bulk of medicaid spending falls under the department of social services in the last fiscal year the state approved $92 billion for the dss $77 billion of which went toward medicaid\n",
            "at first glance this seems like this is the total budget for medicaid in the state there are really no other places in the budget where medicaid is clearly defined as an expense so rowden’s claim about the medicaid budget is false right\n",
            "not so fast\n",
            "in fact medicaid money is spent by more agencies than just the dss it is used for other services spread throughout the state budget most notably in the department of mental health traci gleason the director of communications and public engagement at the missouri budget project confirmed that nearly 20 percent or $2 billion of the medicaid budget goes toward mental health services driving the total budget of medicaid closer to that $10 billion figure\n",
            "where does the rest of medicaid spending go even an expert such as gleason said that’s very tricky to determine part of the reason for this is because portions of the medicaid budget are listed as mo healthnet which is the health care system missouri switched to in 2007\n",
            "through the mo healthnet name a series of supplemental appropriations sections are added at the bottom of the state budget document some of the services funded through supplemental appropriations such as pharmacies physicians and premium services fall under the medicaid budget when you add all the supplemental appropriations together for services that fall under medicaid it comes out to $10023904918 while this falls short of haug’s estimate it does make rowden’s statement about the medicaid budget correct \n",
            "\"it’s really hard to drill down (the medicaid spending) because it’s spread over all sorts of different departments and programs\" gleason said \"overall though sen rowden is correct with his totals\"\n",
            "nevertheless because the state is responsible for funding only 17 percent of the total on medicaid the total amount missouri will spend is $17 billion from state revenue \n",
            "our ruling\n",
            "rowden was trying to illustrate that medicaid spending has reached out-of-control levels according to greitens' budget recommendations for fiscal year 2018 the budget for medicaid has gone up over $1 billion in the last three years and now takes up approximately 37 percent of the state budget despite the growing concern from republicans on the cost of medicaid spending greitens has recommended $107 billion for the service for fiscal year 2018 an increase of over $500 million from fiscal year 2017\n",
            "however it’s important to note that \"we\" — as in the state of missouri — don’t directly fund the entire $10 billion because of the federal medical assistance percentage and the federal reimbursement allowance programs the state only has to spend approximately $17 billion of state revenue on medicaid\n",
            "so while medicaid spending will exceed $10 billion of the nearly $28 billion budget not all of the money is coming directly from the state rowden’s statement is accurate but needs clarification we rate it mostly true\n",

voters was what he would do to make sure president donald trump would be defeated sanders began by saying why it was important to unseat trump\\n\"it\\'s not only that we have a president who wanted to throw 32 million people off of the health care they had after promising that he\\'d provide health care to everybody\" said the vermont independent feb 25 \"this president is the first president in the modern history of our country who is trying to divide our people up based on the color of their skin the country they were born in their sexual orientation their gender their religion\"\\nin this fact-check we examine whether trump wanted 32 million people to lose the health care they had\\ntrump has talked about his health care goals in broad sweeping terms at times even contradicting himself but ultimately governing comes down to legislative and executive action sanders bases his number on trump’s ongoing attempts to overturn the affordable care act we\\'ll put sanders’ claim into context\\nbig promises meet legislative realities\\nin the republican presidential primary trump offered two pillars of his health care plan\\n\"we\\'re getting rid of obamacare\" he said at a march 5 2016 rally \"it\\'s a total disaster that\\'s being replaced and we\\'ll have great health care at a fraction of the cost\"\\nin general trump talked of increasing competition and using the private market to deliver better insurance he also said his goal was to meet the needs of the poorest\\n\"there\\'s going to a group of people at the bottom people that haven\\'t done well\" he said feb 18 2016 \"we\\'re going to take care of them through maybe concepts of medicare\" (medicare is primarily for seniors while medicaid is for the poor so trump’s meaning is unclear)\\nafter the election with republicans in control of the white house and congress the legislative process began trump exhorted republicans to repeal and replace obamacare the first victory came when the house passed the american health care act house republicans gathered with trump at the white house to celebrate trump said \"what we have is something very very incredibly well-crafted\"\\n\"this is a great plan\" trump said may 4 2017 \"i actually think it will get even better and this is make no mistake this is a repeal and replace of obamacare\"\\nthe congressional budget office estimated that the house bill would reduce the number of people who would otherwise be insured by 23 million by 2026\\ntrump later called the house bill \"mean\" and said he hoped the senate version would add more money\\nthe senate struggled to pass health care legislation trump pressed republicans to unify around a bill at a july 24 2017 white house meeting with senators he said the senate version \"will deliver truly great health care\"\\nthe congressional budget office estimated that under the senate bill 15 million people would lose insurance after one year and 22 million by 2026\\nwith a late night dramatic thumbs-down vote from the late arizona sen john mccain the measure failed trump often voiced regret over that moment\\n\\nfeatured fact-check\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndonald trump\\n\\n\\nstated on january 2 2021 in a phone call with georgia\\'s secretary of state\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“you had (4925) out-of-state voters… in georgia”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nby noah y kim • january 4 2021\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"we had health care it was done\" he said in an oct 17 2017 radio interview \"and then a hand went up and then the hand was — went up in the wrong direction at two o\\'clock in the morning and everybody was shocked by it and disappointed\"\\none other proposal had been in play in the senate it would have repealed large pieces of obamacare including the requirement to have insurance expanded medicaid and premium subsidies but it wouldn’t have replaced those with any new programs\\ntrump voiced support for that sort of hardball approach\\n\"if republican senators are unable to pass what they are working on now they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date\" he tweeted june 30 2017\\nif republican senators are unable to pass what they are working on now they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date— donald j trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 30 2017\\n\\ntwo weeks later he repeated that line\\n\"republicans should just repeal failing obamacare now and work on a new health care plan that will start from a clean slate\" trump tweeted july 17 2017 \"dems will join in\"\\nrepublicans should just repeal failing obamacare now & work on a new healthcare plan that will start from a clean slate dems will join in— donald j trump (@realdonaldtrump) july 18 2017\\n\\nthe congressional budget office estimated that the repeal bill would lead to 32 million more people without insurance by 2026 the impact wouldn’t come immediately but it would rise quickly from 17 million in the first year to 27 million after three years then adding another 5 million by the end of the period\\nthe sanders campaign pointed to that estimate as proof that trump wanted to deny 32 million people the health care they otherwise would have\\nbut some portion of that\\xa032 million would have chosen not to buy insurance due\\xa0to the end of the individual mandate the cbo doesn\\'t estimate how many exactly because there are two ways this plays out some people wouldn\\'t buy solely because they no longer face a penalty and others would drop coverage because premiums would rise or insurers would pull out of the markets where they live (the end of the mandate would encourage healthier people to stop buying leaving sicker people in the insurance pool producing higher rates)\\nfor that unknown fraction of people who could have afforded insurance and simply chose not to buy because they didn\\'t have to their insurance wasn\\'t taken away it was something they didn\\'t want\\nultimately no health care bill passed\\nour ruling\\nsanders said that trump \"wanted to throw 32 million people off of the health care they had\" this is based on trump’s encouraging senate republicans to vote for a repeal bill after three years the measure would have reduced the ranks of the insured by 27 million and 32 million after nine years\\nthose are government estimates of the future and not people who would immediately lose insurance as some might understand sanders’ words in addition the 32 million includes some unknown number of people who would choose not to buy insurance soley due to the end of the individual mandate\\nplus\\xa0trump also supported measures that would reduce the number of insured people by 23 million and 22 million this makes it more difficult to tie him to a specific reduction in the number of insured\\nit is reasonable to say that trump backed the loss of insurance for tens of milllions of people over time but not more than that we rate this claim half\\xa0true\\n       share the facts    bernie sanders independent senator from vermont       \\n  \"we have a president who wanted to throw 32
